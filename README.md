# miniRT

## Description 
This project is about creating a 3D viewer using raytracing technique.

Basically the 'RT' technique works just like opposite of a human eye. In real life the light coming from sources hits objects and reflects to eye and that is how we see colors basically. And we'll be sending imaginary rays for each pixel on window and color them depending the object that ray hit and/or the lights around.

## Instructions

To try it out:

- Get your Linux computer.
- Download or pull the repository.
- Place the projects needed for the compilation to the inc/ folder.
	- Your libft as "_libft_" ([click for mine](https://github.com/berkeldemir/libft))
	- Your get_next_line as "_gnl_" ([click for mine](https://github.com/berkeldemir/get_next_line))
	- Minilibx library as "_mlx_" ([click for official 42Paris repo](https://github.com/42paris/minilibx-linux))
- In the root of the folder, type <code>make</code> command.
- All the necessary compilation will be automatically made by the command <code>make</code>.
- You can run the program with the <code>./minirt \<mapname\>.rt</code> command.

> If you experience any-type of error on compiling, you can change the libft and/or gnl with mine which provided above.
